  CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
    Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
    Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
    command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
  
    Environment variable PCL_ROOT is set to:
  
      C:\Program Files\PCL 1.13.0
  
    For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
    By not providing "FindEigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
    asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3", but
    CMake did not find one.
  
    Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3" with any
    of the following names:
  
      Eigen3Config.cmake
      eigen3-config.cmake
  
    Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
    "Eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Eigen3"
    provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
    installed.
